# Modelling-the-Motion-of-a-Tennis-Ball

Jan 2024 - Feb 2024

Working in a group, we used Matlab coding and numerical methods to study the motion of a tennis ball. This included creating plots, investigating different conditions and using varying numerical methods to model it. We also researched other factors which may affect our model and compared our different plots.
This project also included preparing a poster of all our methods and results and a presentation to lecturers.
Overall, including the matlab, poster and presentation, this project scored 81% and contributed towards my grade in the "Mathematical Modelling" module
